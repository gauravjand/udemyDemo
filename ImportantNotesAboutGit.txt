create a repository in github
execute below command to connect remote to local git repo
git remote add origin "https:\\git repo path"
git push -u origin master
-u is required only in the first push

To verify if you have been connected to the remote repo on github, execute below command
git remove-v
you will get 2 outputs , one for fetch and another for pull

To see the history of various commits on local machine:
git log --oneline


To see the version difference:
gitk <filename>

If you are not sure which all files are in local repo:

git ls-files

below commands are used to commit files in local git:
git add <filename>
git commit -m "message like initial commit"

to execute both commands in a single go:

git commit -am "message"

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "gaurav.jand@gmail.com"
Copy the public gile in github
ssh -T git@github


The name of repo can be changed in github by going into settings. Once you cahnge the name of repo, you need to update the settings at local git as well via the follwoing command:

git remote -v command will show the push and fetch urls of remote

use below command to point got origin to newly named repo:

git remote set-url origin "new repo url for ssh"

below command will show all the commits and their headers of the repo

git log --oneline


copy one header

and execute below command

got show <header>

this will show all the adds and deletes at this point of commit




----------How to create a branch on local git and then push it to remote github------------------


git branch -b <branchname>
The above command will create a branch n local git
This branch will contain all the files from the master branch or the branch on top of which you created this branch

Finally push this branch to remote github


git push -u origin <the branch name you wish to push>


to remove a file from git:

git rm <file name>

but after removing you have to commit and push the changes too


To push a branch created locally using "git checkout -b <branchname>", use the below command:

git push -u origin <branch name>



To delete a branch from git and github, follow below steps:

git branch -a tells you all the available branches locally

git branch -d <branch name> deletes the branch locally

you may go and delete the branch on github through UI, but deleting branch on remote doesnt delete the branch from local git, you have to use -d with git branch as told above

But finally, to synch the deleted branch local and remote, do the following:

git fetch -p (p is prune)



Hot to pull the remotely created branch in your local git:

git fetch
